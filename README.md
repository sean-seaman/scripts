Just a collection of some of my scripts. I keep these in a directory added to my 'Path' environment variable so I can run them anywhere from the commandline.

# backup
Backs up directory to parent directory with name "(directory)Backup".

# cleanup
Organizes files in directory from which it is run. Files are stored in folders according to type; .bat scripts are ignored.

# pad
Opens all C++ and text files of current directory in Notepad++.
